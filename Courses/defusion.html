        <h1>Defusion</h1>
        <p>The skill of defusion allows us to become more cognizant of the 
            automaticity of our thoughts and to watch the ones that aren't helpful from a distance.
            The unhelpful thoughts don't go away, but we see them more as the product of our mental mechanisms.
            This allows us to accept how chaotic our thinking can be and direct our attention and our behaviour toward
            thoughts that are useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Meet Your Default Mode Network</h3>
        <p>
            The first step in developing the skill of defusion is to become aware of just how automatic
            and complicated our thought processes are. One way of doing this is to write down a string of thoughts
            that emerge when you give your mind free reign for a few minutes. Try this now: Let your thoughts
            flow naturally and write them down in the textbox below. You may be surprised how circuitous and 
            contradictory your thoughts are. And don't be afraid to write something silly, this is for your eyes only.
        </p>
        <textarea rows="10" cols="60" placeholder="Write your thoughts here..."></textarea>
        <p>
            Sometimes, when we are deeply engaged in a mental task our minds can enter into a state of flow,
            in which thoughts, emotions, and actions are temporarily in sync. But the more usual state is one of
            mind wandering. The parts of the brain involved in mind wandering are known as the <i>default mode network</i>,
            because it is activated automatically when the brain isn't focued on specific tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>Catching Automatic Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            It is natural to engage with these automatic thoughts - this is called cognitive fusion. When we fuse
            with our thoughts we can begin to ruminate, which can lead to anxiety and other mood problems. However,
            it is possible to learn to defuse from our automatic thoughts. Defusing from our thoughts is similar to 
            observing toddlers arguing. We watch with amusement and curiosity, but do nothing else than notice them.
            Here are some exercises to practice defusion...
