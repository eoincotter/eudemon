        <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15px;">Defusion</h1>
        <p>The skill of defusion allows us to become more cognizant of the 
            automaticity of our thoughts and to watch the ones that aren't helpful from a distance.
            The unhelpful thoughts don't go away, but we see them more as the product of our mental mechanisms.
            This allows us to accept how chaotic our thinking can be and direct our attention and our behaviour toward
            thoughts that are useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Meet Your Default Mode Network</h3>
        <p>
            The first step in developing the skill of defusion is to become aware of just how automatic
            and complicated our thought processes are. One way of doing this is to write down a string of thoughts
            that emerge when you give your mind free reign for a few minutes. Try this now: Let your thoughts
            flow naturally and write them down in the textbox below. You may be surprised how circuitous and 
            contradictory your thoughts are. And don't be afraid to write something silly, this is for your eyes only.
        </p>
        <textarea rows="10" cols="60" placeholder="Write your thoughts here..."></textarea>
        <p>
            Sometimes, when we are deeply engaged in a mental task our minds can enter into a state of flow,
            in which thoughts, emotions, and actions are temporarily in sync. But the more usual state is one of
            mind wandering. The parts of the brain involved in mind wandering are known as the <i>default mode network</i>,
            because it is activated automatically when the brain isn't focused on specific tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>Catching Automatic Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            It is natural to engage with these automatic thoughts - this is called cognitive fusion. When we fuse
            with our thoughts we can begin to ruminate, which can lead to anxiety and other mood problems. However,
            it is possible to learn to defuse from our automatic thoughts. Defusing from our thoughts is similar to 
            observing toddlers arguing. We watch with amusement and curiosity, but do nothing else than notice them.
            Before practicing defusion, it is good to get a basic assessment of the degree to which fusion with negative
            thoughts may be causing you distress. The following assessment is called the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire.
            Please rate how true each statement is for you by selecting a number below it. Use the scale below to make
            your choice.
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>1 = never true</li>

          </form>
          <p>
              A rough guideline is that if you score below 20, you are able to think reasonably flexibly. As your score
              moves into the mid to upper 20s and 30s, fusion is becoming more dominant, and defusion exercises will be
              helpful to you in getting needed distance from your thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now that you have evaluated your own level of cognitive fusion, it's time to learn exercises that can be used to 
              improve your defusion skills. Some of these are general exercises for improving defusion, while others can be applied
              when you find yourself fused with inhelpful thoughts. Some of these exercises may seem strange, but stick with them. 
              All of the exercises are <a href="../About/theory.html" style="color: #F1693C">evidence-based and grounded in psychological theory</a>. 
          </p>
          <h3>General Exercise 1: Disobey on Purpose</h3>
          <p>
              Stand up and walk around while reading this next sentence aloud several times: "I cannot walk around this
              room." Keep walking and clearly repeat that sentence at least five or six times as you do so. This exercise 
              is a small demonstration that the mind's power over you is an illusion and this can very quickly give you significant 
              freedom. This can easily be built into your life as a regular practice.
          </p>
          <h3>General Exercise 2: Give Your Mind a Name and Listen to it Politely</h3>
          <p>
              If your mind has a name, then it is different from "you." When you listen to someone else, you can choose to
              agree with what they say or not. That is the posture you want to take with your internal voice. Pick any name 
              you like - even Mr. Mind or Mrs. Mind will do. Now say hello to your mind using its new name, as if you're being 
              introduced to it at a dinner party. You can do this regularly. Every morning you can say "Good morning Mrs. Mind."
          </p>
          <h3>Specific Exercise 1: Appreciate What Your Mind Is Trying to Do</h3>
          <p>
              When your mind starts to chatter, answer back with something like "Thanks for that thought, Mr. Mind. Really, thank you."
              And be sincere. If you speak to your mind dismissively, it will continue with its unhelpful problem solving.
              If your mind pushes back with more unhelpful thoughts, respond again with "Thank you Mrs. Mind. I really do see how you are trying
              to be of use."
          </p>
          <h3>Specific Exercise 2: Sing It</h3>
          <p>
              When you're having a really sticky thought, turn it into a sentence and try singing it - out loud if you are alone,
              in your head if you have company. Any tune will work, for example "Happy Birthday." You don't have to be clever about
              the wording or rhyming. Try different tunes, sing it fast or slow, high or low. The measure of success is not that the 
              thought goes away. It is that you can see it as a thought, and do so just a bit more clearly.
