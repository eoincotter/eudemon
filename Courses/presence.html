				<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15px;">Presence</h1>
				<p>
					We are all surrounded by vast and potentially important information, both inside and outside of us, that generally
					sits there unnoticed and unused, especially when our attention is constrained and rigid. The inability to live in 
					the present enormously reduces the information available to us. It's as if we're playing tennis while wearing
					sunglasses with a lens that's been rubbed with sandpaper. We're distracted by preoccupations that mar a clear view
					of the current moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's a quick exercise to show how our attention becomes limited. Look around the room or area you are in for thirty 
					seconds and find everything that is colored black. Catalog every black item and then bring your eyes <b>BACK HERE</b>
					to these capitalized words. Now, close your eyes and recall absolutely every item you saw that was a rectangle.
				</p>
				<p>
					.......
				</p>
				<p>
					Are you back? Did you have trouble remembering rectangular items? I you were asked to count all the black things you'd seen, 
					you could have done pretty well. But though you probably saw plenty of rectangular shapes - take a look around now for them - 
					your attention was dominated by the rule to find black things, so your mind saw only part of what your eyes saw.
					There is a lesson here: our judgmental, problem solving minds constantly pull our attention away from full awareness of the
					present moment. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The first three flexibility skills are all vital to empowering us to live much more in tune with the present and the 
					learning it affords. All of these skills support us in making the pivot toward presence, away from preoccupations
					with the past and future to the possibilities of today. We can also build a number of practices for cultivating attention
					to the present into our life routines.
				</p>
				<p>
					The skill of presence redirects our yearning for orientation toward mindful focus on the here and now. The mindfulness part 
					is vital; it helps us keep our attention on the potential to live everyday with more meaning and purpose. Mindfulness is 
					paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally. It is also paying attention
					from the eyes of the transcendent self. Mindfulness is also in no way an escape from the pressures and worries, hopes and 
					fears of our lives. Consider the practice of meditation, which is probably the best known element of most forms of 
					mindfulness training. 
					Research shows that meditation is most fruitful when practiced with the aim of building flexibility skills, not as an 
					escape from the pressures of life and a way to suppress feelings. 
				  We want to be present in a way that helps us live in accorance with our chosen values.
					With this understanding of mindfulness, we can see better how the other psychological flexibility 
					skills we've covered help enables. Practicing defusion, connecting with our transcendent self, and opening to acceptance all 
					assist with being non-judgmental and keeping our minds from slipping into rumination or worry. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The following exercises have proven effective at developing presence. Each of these can be performed in just a few minutes, 
					which helps with doing them regularly. Consistent practice is key to lasting results. Ideally you should make a few of these
					part of your flexibility skills toolkit, practicing them often enough that you can do them by heart. You can make them part 
					of your daily life routine. You will immediately begin to see the positive effects on your ability to focus on the things 
					you want to be attending to and that is often highly motivating in continuing with daily commitments. Consider sticking to 
					a daily flexibility practice as your first commitment to living your more values based life. 
				</p>
				<h3>Exercise 1: Simple Meditation</h3>
				<p>
					Sit down (in cross-legged or in a chair with your feet flat on the floor), back straight, eyes slightly open, cast your 
					eyes downwards at a forty-five-degree angle, and maintain a soft focus. Allow your mind to come to rest on your breath.
					Each time your mind has drifted away, release it from that train of thought and then allow it to sttle again on the breath.
					<br>
					That's it. Do it for a few minutes a day.
				</p>
				<h3>Exercise 2: Single and Multiple Targets of Attention</h3>
				<p>
					Two minute guided exercise: "Close your eyes. Direct your attention to the soul of your left foot. Focused on what it feels 
					like. What are the sensations you can feel there? See if you can sense that blood is pulsing through it. See if you can 
					notice how warm or cold it is. See if you can be aware of the amount of space that is taken by your foot."
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice if your attention wanders and gently bring it back to the soul of your left foot. Continue to focus on what your 
					left foot feels like. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Repeat on right foot. Repeat on both feet simultaneously.
				</p>
				<h3>Exercise 3: Broaden and Narrow Attention</h3>
				<p>
					You can train your mind to broaden and narrow its focus by doing attentional work with any rich sensory experience. 
					Listening to music is a great example. Put on some music you like which must featured multiple instruments. 
					You're going to shift your focus from one instrument, or a group of them, such as the strings, to others. It's best to 
					have a plan for where you'll put your attention before you start so that the music doesn't take charge and dictate your focus. 
					You can use a one minute timer on your phone to remind yourself to shift focus. As you listened, first note the combination 
					of instruments and then focus all of your attention on just one of them, say, the bass, or one group of them. After a minute, 
					focus on another, maybe shifting to the drums, and so on. Finally, shift your attention back to the entire band or orchestra. 
					Then cycle through these different focuses again once or twice.
				</p>
				<h3>Exercise 4: Open Your Focus</h3>
				<p>
					Many attention practices teach you to narrow your attention, instructing you to focus on and repeat specific words, or to look 
					only at a small spot on the wall. But it's just as important to broaden your attention. In this exercise you will consider 
					entire sets of events at once. Look at the room you are in, focusing sequentially on specific objects. Then soften the focus 
					on any particular object, and focus on the relationship (the space) between most or all of the objects in the room. With a few 
					minutes practice of alternating between these two sets you sense you're using different attentional strategies. You can feel a 
					softening and expansion of your attention as you adopt an open focus, and then a sharpening and narrowing as you focus on each 
					particular object. A good way to practice this in daily life is during conversations with a group of friends. See if you can 
					flip back and forth between focusing on a specific speaker or listener and then on all of the group at once.
