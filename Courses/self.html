        <p>
            A sense of observing from within our mind from the perspective of an "I" is a constant in our lives. We can call this
            "I" <i>the transcendent self</i> because it is always there within us, no matter where we are, who we're with, and what
            the conditions of our lives are. At the same time, we continually construct a story of our self - crafting <i>the conceptualized
            self</i> - which can block our awareness of our transcendent self. We become so focued on bolsetring and defending this story we weave
            that we end up trying to hide aspects of who we are and of our experiences, not only from others, but from ourselves as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Human beings yearn to be seen, cared for, and included as a member of the group. While this yearning is natural and healthy,
            many of the ways our minds try to satisfy it causes us psychic pain. We lie about ourselves to defend our ego; we play the victim; we berate ourselves
            for failing to meet inflated standards that might please others; and we become consumed by worries about rejection and perceived slights.
            The harm caused can be seen in stark relief when we consider the quest for self-esteem. While high self-esteem is a worthy goal, research shows that when people focus on building, protecting, and
            maintaining self-esteem, they can become less able to focus on what they really value. They are more likely to feel pressured, stressed, and anxious and to 
            be less resilient when facing challenges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Genuine self-esteem is soft and open to our own flaws; the kind built on pretense is rigid, defended, and rejecting of self-honesty. The difference
            between these is fusion with our conceptualized self.
        </p>
        <h3>Connecting with the Transcendent Self</h3>
        <p>
            The Self skill takes the healthy energy of yearning to belong and swings it in the direction of reconnecting with our transcendent self.
            Through perspective-taking we connect with our awareness of our transcendent self in the here and now, which frees us from the grip of
            self-evaluation and the notion that we need to get others to buy into our stories of specialness in order to connect and belong.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Self skill begins by catching the hidden sense of your transcendent self. Here are 4 steps for connecting with our deeper sense of self:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Undermine the attachment to the conceptualised self by applying defusion methods, like those described in the 
            <a href="defusion.html" style="color: #F1693C" target="_blank">Defusion course</a>, to the way we tell stories about ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. See how that opens the mental space to become aware of the perspective-taking that undelries a sense of self that is continuously present.
            When looking at mental content, notice both that the transcendent self is distinct from content ("I am not my thoughts") and that it contains
             content ("I can hold my thoughts in awareness").
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Cultivate habits of perspective-taking through exercises that shift your perspective along the dimensions of time, place, and person.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Use perspective-taking to build a healthy sense of belonging and interconnection with other in consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Repeated, ongoing engagement with exercises will keep strengthening your perspective-taking muscle.
        </p>
        <h3>Exercise 1: I Am/I Am Not</h3>
        <p>
            Below are three unfinished sentences. Complete the top two with one-word answers that represent positive psychological attributes of yours.
            Don't put in mere descriptive attributes (e.g., I am male). Use terms that refer to your most prized personal qualities. In the last sentence,
            list in a single word a personal attribute that you think you have that is negative.
        </p>
        
        <form id="i-am-1" name="i-am-1" action="" onsubmit="return saveIAmInput(this)">
            <p>I am <input type="text" name="i-am-input">. <input style="display: inline;" id="" type="submit" value="Save"></p>            
        </form>
        <form id="i-am-2" name="i-am-2" action="" onsubmit="return saveIAmInput(this)">
            <p>I am <input type="text" name="i-am-input">. <input style="display: inline;" id="" type="submit" value="Save"></p>            
        </form>
        <form id="i-am-3" name="i-am-3" action="" onsubmit="return saveIAmInput(this)">
            <p>I am <input type="text" name="i-am-input">. <input style="display: inline;" id="" type="submit" value="Save"></p>            
        </form>
        <p>
            Let's review the top two "positive" answers. Answer these questions: Is this true all the time? Everywhere? Toward everyone? Without exception?
            What about the bottom one. Is it totally true, everywhere? Probably not. The beginning of a solution is to notice your fusion with these statements.
            In the sentences below, finish them by writing these two words: "or not". Read each of the sentences slowly as you do so.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline;" id="i-am-1-or-not">I am __ , </p><input type="text">
        <br>
        <p style="display: inline;" id="i-am-2-or-not">I am __ , </p><input type="text">
        <br>
        <p style="display: inline;" id="i-am-3-or-not">I am __ , </p><input type="text">
        <p></p>
        <p>
            After reading these a few times, you may feel that you somehow have more options about hwo you think about yourself. The mental process that we 
            are cultivating here is reminding ourselves that we can refuse to buy one version of a story as compared to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now look at the sentences below, where everything after <i>I am</i> has been crossed out. Who would you be without that content? Pause to
            consider the answer.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline;" id="i-am-1-strike">I am __</p>
        <br>
        <p style="display: inline;" id="i-am-2-strike">I am __</p>
        <br>
        <p style="display: inline;" id="i-am-3-strike">I am __</p>
        <p>
            Now focus on the two words that remain - <i>I am</i>. What if the deeper sense of self we seek is closer to these two words alone?
            In crafting the story of our lives, we lose sight of this powerful alternative: just being.
        </p>
        <h3>Exercise 2: One Truthful Conversation at a Time</h3>
        <p>Another good way to let go of your self-story is to practice being yourself more fully and openly with another person. You can do this
            exercise during any conversation with a friend or co-worker you trust, and include more people as time goes on. Look carefully for
            exaggerations, overstatements, half-truths, or pretending to know more than you do. See if you can let go of the attachment to do this and see
        if you can speak more honestly.</p>
