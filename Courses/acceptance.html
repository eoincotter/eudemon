            <p>
                Our problem-solving minds think avoiding painful memories and current experiences is logical.
                Now that you've begun practicing defusion and reconnecting with your transcendent self, it's time for the next
                skill of acceptance - turning toward your pain and beginning to open up to experiencing it and learning from it.
                The defusion and self skills are powerful aids in the difficult work of learning acceptance. By building 
                your acceptance skills you can begin to listen to your painful memories and cope with current distress in a
                less defensive, impulsive way. You'll start to hear helpful messages in place of the avoidant ones. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning acceptance requires exposure - deliberately putting ourselves in emotionally difficult situations.
                Fundamental to the process of exposure is the understanding that progress will be gradual. The fruits of developing the skill
                of acceptance take time to ripen, and incremental steps are best. Over time your acceptance muscles become stronger and new
                experiences become less threatening. The emotional flexibility you develop is vital in committing to the new course of
                values-based living you chart for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the methods for developing acceptance are premised on three underlying prinviples:
                <br>
                1. Avoidance causes pain.
                <br>
                2. Acceptance is in the service of valued living.
                <br>
                3. Acceptance is not about control.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes people try to stay partially emotionally closed as they practice exposure. That will seriously
                undermine getting the benefits, and when you need to accept the most difficult experiences, the skills
                will not be there. On the other hand, overwhelming yourself by trying to tackle your most difficult feelings
                right away is counterproductive. Start with feelings, memories, and current experiences that are less intense.
                Others can wait until you've developed greater flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a core starter set of practices for developing acceptance. One last point to make is that taking 
                acceptance to the max is often best done with professional help, and you can find a list of ACT therapists 
                <a href="https://contextualscience.org/civicrm/profile?gid=17&reset=1&force=1" target="_blank" style="color: #F1693C">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Exercise 1: Say "Yes"</h3>
            <p>
                A core skill in acceptance is to be willing to have events be what they are. You can start practicing just by
                looking around. As your eyes land on anything, see what it feels like to look at it from the point of view of
                "no" meaning "no, that's no good; that has to change; I want the hell out of here; that is unaccetpable." Move
                to another item and again adopt a "no" approach to it. Do this over and over for a couple of minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now repeat the scan but this time do it from the perspective of "yes" meaning "yes, that's OK; that is just like that;
                it does not have to change; I can allow that to be just as it is." Again, repeat this a number of times on different 
                objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a pause and see if you can sense how different the world seems inside "yes" versus "no". The "yes" and "no"
                ways of looking at the world tap into a similar mind-set: the open and accepting one and the avoidant and controlling
                one. You can move on to do this exercise with specific thoughts, emotions, urges, and memories. Over time, you will
                begin to notice as you go through your daily routines that sometimes you settle mentally into the "no" posture without
                meaning to. Noticing the mental cues can help you catch yourself and consciously adopt a "yes" posture instead.
            </p>
            <h3>Exercise 2: A Caring Exercise</h3>
            <p>Pick a feeling or experience that you have a hard time accepting, one that's leading to unhelpful resistance.
                Start small. Then envision one of the following for at least one minute.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold your experience as you would hold a delicate flower in your hand.</li>
                <li>Look at your experience the way you would look at an incredible painting.</li>
                <li>Walk around the room with your experience the way you would walk while carrying a sobbing infant.</li>
                <li>Honor your experience the way you would honor a friend, by listening carefully even if it was hard.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These metaphorical ways of treating your feelings, memories, and current experiences are often powerful in building
                acceptance. That's true even if as you consider them your mind says, "I don't know how to do that." Give them
                a try over time with different memories, experiences, emotions, urges, or thoughts.
            </p>
            <h3>Exercise 3: A Wider View</h3>
            <p>
                Feeling something painful or difficult tends to cause us to focus our attention narrowly, allowing pain or fear to
                loom large in our minds. If we bring a wider perspective to the experience, we can more effectively open up to the gift
                buried inside it. Take some time to conjure up a difficult experience, bringing it fully to mind, and then consider these
                questions.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is there a specific bodily sensation that is associated with this experience, and can you say "yes" just to that sensation></li>
                <li>Have you seen anyone in your family struggle with something like this experience, and if so can you bring that memory
                    to mind with the purpose of looking at their experience with compassion?</li>
                <li>Is there a specfic thought associated with this experience, and can you say "yes" just to that thought?</li>
                <li>If you were to look back on your life from a wiser future, would you say there is something in this experience for you to learn from?</li>
                <li>What does this experience and your struggles with it suggest you deeply care about? In your pain you find your values: what does this painful area say about your values and vulnerabilities? What does it suggest about what you want? </li>
                <li>If this experience were in a book you were writing, how might the character experiencing it become wiser or more alive as a result? </li>
                <li>Are there other memories associated with this experience? Can you say "yes" just to one more? </li>
                <li>If you blame someone for this experience, can you think of times that you have done something like what they did? Perhaps in a lesser way? </li>
                <li>If someone else you care about were struggling with an experience like this, how would you feel? What might you suggest that they do? How do you feel about them knowing that they have this issue? What would you say to them about what they might do? </li>
                <li>What do you have to do to let go of the struggle with this experience? </li>
                <li> If you could feel this experience without defense, what would you be able to do in your life? Allow yourself to reach out and dream.</li>
