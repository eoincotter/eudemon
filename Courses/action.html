				<p>
                    Without the skill of action, we are at risk of backsliding on all of the progress we've made in the previous steps. 
                    But once we commit to building values based habits of action, we secure our progress with all of the flexibility skills. 
                    Taking action that helps us get where we want to go requires us to employ the other skills, reinforcing their importance. 
                    Committed action brings the six skills together into a healthy, ongoing process of acting as you choose. 
				</p>
                <p>
                    Simplistic cultural mantras like just do it don't do the process of committed action justice. They imply that the process 
                    isn't really so hard. But it is, and we're simply not going to be immediately competent in building values based habits. 
                    One of the difficult aspects of learning new skills or habits of any kind is delayed gratification. We're not going to see 
                    big pay offs right away, and we will experience plenty of frustration, even pain, during the competence journey.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Envisioning a future in which we've mastered the new behavior we're committed to leads us into the competency conundrum: 
                    our problem solving mind wants to get us to that future now, and that fixation on future success and external achievement 
                    undercuts the will to stick with the process that builds competence. The problem solving mind may also convince us that 
                    success is an end state, rather than an ongoing process of learning. It can also feed with thoughts like these: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <ol><b>*I will feel self-confident when I marry an attractive spouse.</b></ol>
                    <ol><b>*I will no longer struggle with the pain of my childhood when I'm famous.</b></ol>
                    <ol><b>*I will stop worrying about the future when I have a lot of money.</b></ol>
                    <ol><b>*My anxiety and self-doubt will go away when I get a promotion.</b></ol>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And despite their appearances, some forms of persistence are actually forms of avoidance, driven by fear (of failure, 
                    for example). Workaholism and perfectionism are examples. These rigid forms of persistence carry with them a strong 
                    negative health impact as well as leading people to ignore relationships and recreation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill of action takes the yearning for competence and directs it toward building habits of values-based actions
                    that are authentically meaningful to us.
                </p>
                <h3>SMART Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    As we embark on committing to a new plan of action, we should develop SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, 
                    results-focused, and time-bound. It does not help to set a goal like "I will be better" because it has no increments of 
                    progress. It's counterproductive to set unrealistic expectations such as “I will never feel depressed again.” and setting 
                    a realistic timeframe for achievement of a goal helps to tamp down the sense of urgency about achieving it now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other flexibility skills help with commitment to the actions that will allow us to achieve these goals. Diffusion allows 
                    us to distance ourselves from negative thoughts and judgements about our progress. Connecting to our transcendence self keeps 
                    our focus on taking action because we care, not to comply with social expectations or avoid guilt. Acceptance helps us maintain 
                    our great when the going gets tough. Presence helps to stay focused on the process rather than the end goal- and how far from 
                    it we are. Connecting with our values reminds us that these difficult actions are in the service of living the life we will 
                    find meaningful, rather than in service of proving our self-worth or escaping from difficult experiences. 
                </p>
                <h3>Making the Action Pivot</h3>
                <p>
                    Make the action pivot by answering this question:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Based on the distinction between you as a conscious being and the story the mind tells of who you are, in this time and 
                    situation are you willing to experience your experiences as they are, not as what they say they are, fully and without 
                    needless defense, and direct your attention and effort toward creating larger and larger habits of behavior that reflect 
                    your chosen values? YES or NO?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life asks this question of you over and over and over - without end. Just as we have within us the knowledge about the value 
                    of the other flexibility skills, so too we have within us the awareness that we have the power to take the actions to change 
                    our lives. If your answer is "yes", then it is time to move onto your action steps. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are some general methods to help change your actions toward a life you find meaningful. These are core skills that
                    need to be tailored to the specifics of the challenges you are working on. In fact this applies to all of the psychological
                    flexibility skills that you have been developing. Eudemon provides many courses tailored to using
                    your newly developed skills of defusion, self, acceptance, presence, values, and action in specific domains, divided into four
                    themes: <a href="../index.html#positive-emotion" target="_blank" style="color: #F1693C">positive emotion</a>,

                    You can also create your own Eudemon toolkit of your favorite exercises and continue to practice those regularly.
                </p>
                <h3>General Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    Behavior change is hard, and it's generally best to start small. Continuing to build your other flexibility skills will be 
                    of great help in tackling progressively more difficult commitments. It is advised that you start your behavior change efforts 
                    by applying these first 2 methods to a couple or a few of the actions you'd like to commit to that you wrote down in the 
                    values writing exercise in the last chapter. Keep working on those until the behaviors become easy for you and you are fully 
                    ncommitted to them. 
                </p>
                <h4>Exercise 1: Make Small Adjustments</h3>
                <p>
                    The wonderful (and terrable) taking about human behavior is that it tends to support itself. Lives fall into behavioral
                    patterns. We do what we do, because it's always what we've done. This can become problematic for all the reasons described: 
                    we could fall into psychologically rigid habits. But small behavioral direction changes can build to create a huge change in 
                    direction overtime. The trick is to calibrate your efforts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially it's best to make changes that are simple and quick. If you want to read more and watch less television, start 
                    with no television after work until you bread for 30 minutes. Even if the commitment you've decided on is small, it can 
                    help to make it smaller still. Make it 15 minutes of reading, or could I to single show you think is mindless but you 
                    find yourself watching anyway (do you really need to see more back episodes of cupcake wars?). It does not matter how 
                    small it is. You're making progress. 
                </p>
                <h4>Exercise 2: Work New Habits into Established Routines</h3>
                <p>
                    It is wise to create new behavioral habits that are initially anchored to your regular activities so that they can cue 
                    the new behavior. It is far easier to combine habits than to swap them out cold. For example, suppose you want to eat 
                    more fruit and less refined sugar but you find that you are regularly eating a cookie soon after you wake up. If you 
                    have a morning coffee you might focus on creating a habit of grabbing an Apple as you grab your coffee, taking it to 
                    your favorite chair, and taking a small bite before your first sip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose you want to be more effective in managing your work habits. You might set a goal of answering all emails each 
                    day so your inbox doesn't get overstuffed. Soon you'll likely have some tough days and not get them all answered, and 
                    you might then just give up. If instead you established a habit of answering emails for, say, 30 minutes over your morning 
                    coffee, that email habit would be easier to establish.
